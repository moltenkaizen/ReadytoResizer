# ReadytoResizer

ReadytoResizer is a Figma plugin for designers who work with screenshots during research and QA processes. When importing high-DPI screenshots from modern devices, they are full physical resolution but need to be scaled down to their logical size for proper comparison and analysis.

This plugin automatically wraps selected images in frames with proper constraints and locked aspect ratio, making it easy to resize from physical dimensions to logical dimensions while maintaining perfect proportions.

### Key use cases:

* Design Research: Quickly resize app screenshots and reference images to appropriate sizes for inspiration boards and research documentation
* UI Verification/QA: Scale developer-built screenshots to match your design comps for accurate side-by-side comparisons during the design review process

### Features:

* Automatically frames selected high-DPI images
* Sets stretch constraints so images scale proportionally within frames
* Locks aspect ratios to maintain proportions during resizing
* Optional custom frame naming
* Handles multiple images at once

Essential for design teams who need to efficiently process screenshots for research analysis and development QA workflows.

### How to use:
* Install this plugin
* Run it
* Select images you wish to resize
* Optionally enter a name for the resized frames
* Press "Go" button or Enter key
* Now proceed to resize the new framed images using Figma device presets or a custom size
