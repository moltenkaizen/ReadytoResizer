# ReadtoResizer

Ready to Resizer is a Figma plugin designed for designers who work with mobile screenshots during research and QA processes. When importing high-DPI screenshots from modern devices, they often appear at their full physical resolution but need to be scaled down to their logical size for proper comparison and analysis.
This plugin automatically wraps selected images in frames with proper constraints and locked aspect ratios, making it easy to resize from physical dimensions to logical dimensions while maintaining perfect proportions.
Key use cases:

Design Research: Quickly resize competitor app screenshots and reference images to appropriate sizes for inspiration boards and research documentation
UI Verification/QA: Scale developer-built screenshots to match your design comps for accurate side-by-side comparisons during the design review process

Features:

Automatically frames selected high-DPI images
Sets stretch constraints so images scale proportionally within frames
Locks aspect ratios to maintain proportions during resizing
Optional custom frame naming
Handles multiple images at once

Essential for design teams who need to efficiently process mobile screenshots for research analysis and development QA workflows.
